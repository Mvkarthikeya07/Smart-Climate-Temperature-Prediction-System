🌡 Time-Series and Regression Analysis for Ambient Temperature Prediction Using Machine Learning

A professional, end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts ambient temperature using environmental and sensor data.
The system demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle — from data processing and model training to real-time inference via a clean Flask-based web interface.

📌 Project Overview

Accurate temperature prediction is a critical component of climate monitoring, smart city infrastructure, and environmental analytics.

This project focuses on building a statistical, learning-based prediction system, rather than a rule-based or lookup approach.
The model learns underlying patterns from historical sensor data and generalizes them to predict temperature for unseen inputs.

Key Design Goals

Clean and modular architecture

Reliable end-to-end ML workflow

Real-world data handling

Professional deployment-ready structure

🧠 Machine Learning Details

Problem Type: Supervised Learning (Regression)

Model Used: Linear Regression

Target Variable: Temperature (°C)

The model learns relationships between atmospheric features and temperature rather than memorizing individual records.
Minor deviations between predicted and actual values are expected and desirable, indicating healthy model generalization.

🗂 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of real-world environmental and sensor measurements.

Features Used

sensor_id

lat — Latitude

lon — Longitude

pressure — Atmospheric pressure (Pa)

humidity — Relative humidity (%)

temperature — Target variable (°C)

⚠️ Note:
The dataset is stored in a compressed format to comply with GitHub file size limitations while maintaining full project reproducibility.
